# TryingWInAPI

Trying out WinAPI and attempting to make a dll injector, I have my desired DLL file but it's on my laptop, so for now I'm trying to make the injector.
Update: The DLL injector works, I also checked it with my DLL, so it's all good.
I wanna see what poject I can come up with later on.
